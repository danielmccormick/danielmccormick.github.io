# Security Policy

This is my personal website, it should not request any data from the end user whatsoever. 
It's a static website run on github pages, with no personal information of any significance. 

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Trunk   | :white_check_mark: |
| Others  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

It's unclear what's actually at risk, but if you see a vulnerability, feel free to email me at the one on my github page. 

If it's a trivial vulnerability, ideally mentioned by dependabot, then I'll fix it at my leisure. If there's by some extreme misfortunate, 
a severe vulnerability, I will make the repository private. 

I'm adding this file to comply with the security reccomendations but have no advice or opinion whatsoever. 

Thanks!
