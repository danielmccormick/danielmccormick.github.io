Hi there! My name is Daniel McCormick.     

I'm a computer engineering student at UWaterloo. I'm interested in cooking, reading, writing, puzzles and sometimes programming

You can find my github [here](github.com/danielmccormikc), but I'd presume if you've come to this page you already know that.
While I know a variety of languages (including VHDL, ASM(ARM,x86), C, Pascal, Python, and Javscript), I tend to commit a lot of C++ (C++14 in particular these days).
I attribute this to my interest in lightweight abstractions and large templating error messages.


You can additionally find my goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/danielmccormick), but I don't maintain it very well. If you have any good book reccomendations (particularly non-fiction or mystery), please do let me know.

Resume TBD.
