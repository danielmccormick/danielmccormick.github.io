Hi there! My name is Daniel McCormick.     

I'm a computer engineering student at UWaterloo. I'm interested in cooking, reading, writing and sometimes programming

You can find my github [here](github.com/danielmccormikc), but I'd presume if you've come to this page you already know that. While I know a variety of languages (including VHDL, Asm, C, Python, and Javscript), I tend to commit a lot of C++. I attribute this to my interest in lightweight abstractions and large templating error messages.

You can additionally find my goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/danielmccormick), but I don't maintain it very well. If you have any good book reccomendations, please do let me know.

Resume TBD.
